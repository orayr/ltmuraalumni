What has been done for multi error
==================================

For each of the phases of docxtemplater engine, I have added an error-collecting mechanism that does :

-	for lexing, collect errors in unclosed/unopened tags
-	for parsing, collect errors in angular-parser (or custom parser)
-	for postparsing, collect errors in :
	-	loops (unclosed loop, unopened loop, unmatching loop)
	-	rawxml (rawtag not in paragraph / not only text in paragraph)
-	Add an offset property to all errors so that they can be found by the error-location module
-	Update the error messages and explanation to have the same formatting
-	Move all error throwing code to one file (errors.js) to ensure that the formatting of errors can be checked easily
-	Added a mechanism so that modules can "get and transform errors on the fly" (it is used by the location module to add the wordcount)

Added tests in tests/errors.js for each error cases

What has been done for location module
======================================

-	Use the mechanism of docxtemplater to catch and transform errors.
-	On initialization, after lexing, read the document to find out all words in the files and their position.
-	Transform the offsets into wordPositions.

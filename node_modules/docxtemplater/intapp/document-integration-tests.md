How you can write integration tests
===================================

You can write integration tests in your application for docxtemplater by using the function expectSame documented in `document-two-documents-are-the-same.md`

I personally have an API that generates docx, I test it using expectSame by making real HTTP requests. I send the docx input + data and verify that the generated output is the same as the one that I saved before.
